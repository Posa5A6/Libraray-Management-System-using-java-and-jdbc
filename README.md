Your library management system project involves two interconnected Java programs: one for managing books and the other for managing students. Here’s a breakdown of the key points and features:

 Project Overview
- Books Program: Manages the 'books' table, with operations to insert, update, delete, and view book details.
- Students Program: Manages the 'students' table, tracking which books students borrow and updating the 'books' table accordingly.

 Key Features
1. Table Management:
   - Each program checks for the existence of the respective table and creates it if it doesn’t exist, ensuring smooth operation even on a fresh database setup.

2. Books Program:
   - CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for book records, with user input required for all insert operations.
   - Navigation to Students Program: Provides a method to switch to the 'students' program, allowing users to manage students and borrowed books.

3. Students Program:
   - Book Borrowing System: Tracks which books a student has borrowed, with details like book ID and name.
   - Availability Check: Verifies if the requested book is available before allowing a student to borrow it. If unavailable, it navigates to the 'books' program for updates and returns afterward.
   - Student Detail Management: Allows updating student information such as name, ID, email, etc.
   - Inventory Update: When a book is borrowed, it reduces the book’s quantity in the 'books' table. Additionally, it decreases the number of available library cards for the student.

4. Interlinked Programs:
   - Each program can navigate to the other as needed, making the system more cohesive and user-friendly.

5. Extendability:
   - Open to additional features, such as a return system for borrowed books, fines for late returns, or advanced reporting capabilities on borrowing patterns and popular books.
